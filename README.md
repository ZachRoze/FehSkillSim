# FEH Weapon Skill Simulator
[Try it out here](https://fehskillsim.herokuapp.com/)

Because of new prf weapons that come out that look like encyclopedias, it would be fun to guess what the new prfs will be.
Using existing skill "phrases" such as "if unit initiates combat" and "unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack", make a brand new prf.

Uses Flask for python web integration.

# Functionality
Add a weapon name and supply parameters such as "weapon type" (e.g. melee or tome), "move type" (e.g. armor or flying),
and "power" from weak to broken.
Output currently is a text string that corresponds to the power levels, and innate skills on weapon and move types.
Will have more skills, output as png, and a cleaner design in the future.
